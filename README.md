Dashboard Summary: Customer Churn Analysis

The customer churn dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of churn behavior across the customer base. The overall churn rate stands at approximately 14.5%, indicating that while the majority of customers are retained, a meaningful portion is being lost and requires attention.

The dashboard highlights a clear imbalance between retained and churned customers, with retained customers forming the large majority. However, deeper insights show that churn is not random. Customers who churn tend to use the service more heavily and contact customer support more frequently, suggesting dissatisfaction driven by service quality, billing concerns, or unmet expectations.

Customer tenure (account length) shows only a weak relationship with churn, meaning both newer and long-term customers are susceptible. This implies that loyalty alone does not guarantee retention and that ongoing service experience plays a critical role.

One of the most important insights from the dashboard is the strong association between customer service calls and churn. Customers who churn make significantly more support calls than those who stay, making this a key early warning indicator. High-usage customers and those with more complex service needs (such as international calling) also show higher churn risk.

Overall, the dashboard emphasizes that customer experience and service quality are the primary drivers of churn, rather than demographics or tenure. Proactive customer support, early intervention for high-usage customers, and improved issue resolution could significantly reduce churn and improve customer retention.
