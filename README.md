Customer Churn Dashboard & Usage Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes customer churn using Power BI and Power Query to identify patterns, risk factors, and actionable insights for improving retention. The Customer Churn Dashboard provides a clear, visual overview of churn behavior across the customer base.

Key Insights:

Overall churn rate: ~14.5%, indicating that while most customers are retained, a notable portion is at risk.

Retention vs churn: Most customers are retained, but churn is concentrated among high-usage customers and those interacting frequently with customer support.

Customer tenure: Weak correlation with churn-both new and long-term customers may leave, highlighting the importance of continuous service quality.

Support calls: Customers who churn make significantly more support calls, making it a key early warning indicator.

Service usage: High-usage and complex-service customers (e.g., international calling) are at higher risk of churn.

Primary drivers: Service quality and customer experience are stronger predictors of churn than demographics or tenure.

Business Questions Addressed:

What is the overall customer churn rate?

How many customers have churned vs retained?

Which age groups show the highest churn?

Does churn differ between male and female customers?

How does customer usage frequency impact churn?

Is there a relationship between customer tenure and churn?

Which subscription type (Basic, Standard, Premium) has the highest churn?

How does contract length (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual) affect churn?

Does the number of support calls influence customer churn?

Are payment delays associated with higher churn?

Which customer segments are most at risk of churning?

What key factors contribute most to customer churn?

Actionable Recommendations:

Implement proactive support for high-usage or at-risk customers.

Monitor customers with frequent support calls for early intervention.

Improve service quality, billing transparency, and issue resolution.

Personalize engagement for high-risk segments to boost retention.

Tools Used:

Power Query: Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

Power BI: Interactive dashboards, visualizations, and analytics

Impact:
By visualizing churn patterns and key risk factors, this dashboard enables data-driven strategies to reduce churn, enhance customer experience, and protect revenue.
